# WANNA Virtual Fitting Room

WANNA Virtual Fitting Room (VFR) is a low-code solution with a customizable prebuilt UI. To integrate it into your
website, you only need to add an iframe to the page. The user will be able to try on the products in real time using
their smartphone camera and to explore the 3D image of the product on a separate screen.

The Virtual Fitting Room allows users to try on footwear, watches, bags, and scarves in augmented reality, as well as
explore products of any category in the 3D Viewer.

For watches, the size of the watch face is essential to the look. That's why the fitting room provides a tool to measure
the user's wrist size, then loads a model of the appropriate size to give the user a realistic picture of the watch on
their wrist.

For bags and scarves, the fitting room supports a seamless way to try on different styling options for the same SKU,
allowing users to easily match them with their outfits and find the best option.
